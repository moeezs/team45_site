            <h2 class="section-title">1.0. Intro</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                The Yale School of Art website uses a unique and unconventional design that reflects the creativity and artistry of its institution. 
                However, while it embraces artistic freedom, the site violates several key principles of good user interface design, resulting in a chaotic and difficult experience for users.
                From inconsistent layouts, hard-to-read elements, and poor navigation/accessibility, the Yale School of Art website highlights the consequences that occur when form takes precedence over function. 
                Its failure to adhere to the principles of consistency, ease of navigation, and universal usability demonstrates the importance of balancing creativity with user needs.

        <div class="report-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">1.1. Consistency</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                The Yale School of Art website struggles with consistency in both layout and design, which makes it confusing for users to navigate. 
                Each page feels completely different, with no standard structure for things like headers, navigation, or content layout. 
                Fonts and colors change dramatically between sections, which disrupts the flow and forces users to constantly re-learn how to use the site. 
                There’s no evidence of a consistent design system, like reusable stylesheets or frameworks, to tie everything together. 
                Adding a consistent navigation bar, unified fonts, and a standard layout would go a long way in improving the user experience while still keeping the creative aesthetic of the site intact.

        </div>

        <div class="report-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">1.2. Ease of Navigation</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                Navigating the Yale School of Art website is an unnecessarily difficult experience due to its disorganized structure and lack of clear pathways. 
                Links are scattered randomly on the pages, often blending into the chaotic design and making them hard to spot. 
                Key navigation links, like a homepage button or quick access to important sections like "Admissions," are buried in a long list of links at the side of the page. 
                The lack of clear organization or visual hierarchy makes it tough to figure out where to go next. 
                A simple navigation bar with clear, well-placed links would make finding information on the website much easier and less frustrating for users.
            </p>

        <div class="report-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">1.3. Universal Usability</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                The website fails to fully meet the standard for universal usability, limiting its effectiveness for a diverse audience. 
                While it is semi-responsive to different screen sizes, it results in poor functionality on smaller screen sizes, as a lot of important elements like the navigation links go missing. 
                This can create a more frustrating experience for users with smaller screens, especially for mobile users. 
                By better incorporating responsive design techniques and adding more accessibility features, the site could offer a more inclusive experience for all of its users.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="report-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">1.4. Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                The Yale School of Art website, while visually expressive and reflective of its institution’s artistic values, ultimately fails to provide a functional and user-friendly experience. 
                Through its lack of consistency, poor navigation, and inaccessible design, the site demonstrates why usability must remain a top priority in web design. 
                Balancing creativity with structure and adopting modern design frameworks could transform the site into a professional yet artistic platform that can better serve its users. 
                As it stands, the Yale School of Art website serves as an example of the importance of sticking to core design principles in order to create a more effective and accessible web application.
