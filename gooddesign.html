            <h2 class="section-title">1.0. Intro</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                LinkedIn, the site widely considered to be the best job site for professionals and home to industry leaders and employers, boasts ideal responsive and streamlined design, providing the best possible experience to their users. 
                From the moment you enter the site, greeted by soft, light colours with popping icons and suggestions, LinkedIn guides users to all the locations they’re looking for and more. 
                The combination of LinkedIn’s consistency, ease of use, usability, and streamlined simplification makes it an industry staple with a great user experience.

        <div class="report-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">1.1. Consistency</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                LinkedIn simplifies their navigation through their consistent header element consisting of a home button, search bar, and toggleable navigation between home, networking, jobs, profile and more. 
                This header follows the page between each linked page, ensuring the user has a consistent means of navigating the site. 
                Between these pages, each page consists of two general side elements and a main content section in the middle, compressing down to the main element with responsive design, or expanding to 768px for a max width. 
                As it is designed to scroll, LinkedIn avoids the traditional footer, instead opting for a messaging status bar for communication, shrinking away, along with certain elements of the header, to scale to a mobile design. 
                With between page consistency of style, layout, and colour scheme, along with responsive design, LinkedIn ensures that their users have a comfortable, consistent experience over the duration of their stay.

        <div class="report-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">1.2. Ease of Navigation</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                LinkedIn utilizes a simplified design for links, not only through their header, but dropdown menus for navigation between more complicated sections and appropriate icons to guide based on imagery instead of reading comprehension. 
                Single-click shortcuts are obvious and easily accessed, only hidden behind a maximum of one dropdown, with no dropdowns embedded within dropdowns to prevent confusion, along with easy links to navigate back to home or profile pages. 
                All LinkedIn’s links are also responsive across platforms, responding to click, touch, and hover elements, through their display design. 
                The culmination of navigation elements on LinkedIn makes it a strong contender as an easily navigable web app, improving the quality of the app by the improvement to user experience.

        <div class="report-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">1.3. Universal Usability</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                Because of the need for communication on the go, LinkedIn has to ensure that all devices are covered to explore a responsive design, lest they lose users due to poor layouts and frustration. 
                Fortunately, with a previously listed scalable and responsive header and content design, LinkedIn ensures universal experience across all types of displays. 
                This is partially due to their use of the Play Framework meant for universally scalable design and implementation over platforms. 
                This is continued through their use of mediaqueries to adjust the design further upon strong compression factors, as well as limiting expansion to ensure a common appearance to collective audiences. 
                With these features, LinkedIn ensures that they are not limited by devices as for who their application can reach.

            <h2 class="section-title">1.4. Error Prevention</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                This is a harder area to speak to, given the constraints of a user looking down onto the web application. 
                However, due to their consistent use of single-click shortcuts, LinkedIn avoids potential navigational errors, and, as the site is regularly updated, potential errors are quickly reported and resolved within a timely manner. 
                LinkedIn also avoids allowing links to lead to pages within their search bars, preventing from navigating through broken links and addresses. 
                Overall, as a maintained site, LinkedIn features elite error prevention, such to the point where it is exceedingly difficult to encounter errors.

            <h2 class="section-title">1.5. Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="section-paragraph">
                LinkedIn solidifies itself as a model of good modern web design through its use of its header elements, simplified navigation, and responsive usability to reach and captivate broader audiences. 
                Through the continued efforts to support each device and keep the design sleek and streamlined, LinkedIn ensures that it stays true to its purpose of being the ultimate site for professionals to network, connect, and communicate. 
                LinkedIn will continue to thrive in its online prowess, following the pillars of web app design.
